## Overview

The **DICOM to PDF Converter** is a powerful and user-friendly web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that enables healthcare professionals, radiologists, and researchers to quickly convert entire collections of DICOM medical images into high-quality, square-format PDF documents. This tool simplifies reviewing and sharing MRI, CT, and other medical imaging scans by generating visually enhanced PDFs with a sleek black background and clear, white text annotations.

Designed with both usability and professionalism in mind, the application supports bulk uploads of zipped DICOM folders, automatically processes the images on the backend, and delivers a downloadable PDF with patient and scan metadata elegantly displayed on each page.

## Features

* **Easy Upload:** Upload zipped folders containing your DICOM files directly through the web interface. No need for complex software or command-line usage.
* **Automatic Extraction:** The app unzips and processes all included DICOM files seamlessly in a temporary backend environment.
* **High-Quality PDF Generation:** Generates square pages optimized for display and printing with a stylish black background and white text for easy viewing in dark environments.
* **Contrast Enhancement:** Advanced image normalization enhances scan visibility for better diagnostic review.
* **Metadata Display:** Each page displays relevant patient and scan metadata (e.g., patient name, series description) for quick identification.
* **Interactive Web Interface:** Powered by Streamlit, offering a responsive, modern, and intuitive user experience.
* **Downloadable Output:** Users receive a direct download link for their generated PDF after processing completes.

## Why Use This Tool?

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files are the standard format for medical imaging. However, viewing or sharing these files often requires specialized software, which can be cumbersome or unavailable on some devices.

This tool provides a universal, portable format by converting DICOM scans into PDFs that:

* Can be opened easily on virtually any device.
* Are ideal for archiving, sharing with colleagues or patients, and inclusion in reports.
* Provide clear, enhanced visualization without sacrificing image quality.
* Include important metadata for context and documentation.

Whether you’re a medical professional needing to compile imaging data or a researcher archiving scans, this converter streamlines your workflow.
